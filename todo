# Steps :

1 - Implement data loader
    a - load users from MongoDB
    b - load activities from MongoDB
    c - load likes/dislikes from MongoDB
    d - load all the data into an number_users * number_categories matrix and assign to each one the weight of the category

2 - Implement K-means cluster to create the clusters
    a - k-mean elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters
    b - create clusters based on euclidean distance between the users (between category weights)
3 - Save the result model in a persistence db
4 -
